  abstract = {In this work we show that adapting Deep Convolutional Neural Network training to the task of boundary detection can result in substantial improvements over the current state-of-the-art in boundary detection. Our contributions consist firstly in combining a careful design of the loss for boundary detection training, a multi-resolution architecture and training with external data to improve the detection accuracy of the current state of the art. When measured on the standard Berkeley Segmentation Dataset, we improve theoptimal dataset scale F-measure from 0.780 to 0.808 - while human performance is at 0.803. We further improve performance to 0.813 by combining deep learning with grouping, integrating the Normalized Cuts technique within a deep network. We also examine the potential of our boundary detector in conjunction with the task of semantic segmentation and demonstrate clear improvements over state-of-the-art systems. Our detector is fully integrated in the popular Caffe framework and processes a 320x420 image in less than a second.},

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results.

  abstract = {Multilayer neural networks trained with the back-propagation algorithm constitute the best example of a successful gradient based learning technique. Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day},

  abstract = {Detecting small objects such as vehicles in satellite images is a difficult problem. Many features (such as histogram of oriented gradient, local binary pattern, scale-invariant feature transform, etc.) have been used to improve the performance of object detection, but mostly in simple environments such as those on roads. Kembhavi et al. proposed that no satisfactory accuracy has been achieved in complex environments such as the City of San Francisco. Deep convolutional neural networks (DNNs) can learn rich features from the training data automatically and has achieved state-of-the-art performance in many image classification databases. Though the DNN has shown robustness to distortion, it only extracts features of the same scale, and hence is insufficient to tolerate large-scale variance of object. In this letter, we present a hybrid DNN (HDNN), by dividing the maps of the last convolutional layer and the max-pooling layer of DNN into multiple blocks of variable receptive field sizes or max-pooling field sizes, to enable the HDNN to extract variable-scale features. Comparative experimental results indicate that our proposed HDNN significantly outperforms the traditional DNN on vehicle detection.},

Land cover classification, object detection and scene understanding in aerial images rely more and more on deep networks to achieve new state-of-the-art results. Recent architectures such as Fully Convolutional Networks can even produce pixel level annotations for semantic mapping. In this work, we present a deep-learning based segment-before-detect method for segmentation and subsequent detection and classification of several varieties of wheeled vehicles in high resolution remote sensing images. This allows us to investigate object detection and classification on a complex dataset made up of visually similar classes, and to demonstrate the relevance of such a subclass modeling approach. Especially, we want to show that deep learning is also suitable for object-oriented analysis of Earth Observation data as effective object detection can be obtained as a byproduct of accurate semantic segmentation. First, we train a deep fully convolutional network on the ISPRS Potsdam and the NZAM/ONERA Christchurch datasets and show how the learnt semantic maps can be used to extract precise segmentation of vehicles. Then, we show that those maps are accurate enough to perform vehicle detection by simple connected component extraction. This allows us to study the repartition of vehicles in the city. Finally, we train a Convolutional Neural Network to perform vehicle classification on the VEDAI dataset, and transfer its knowledge to classify the individual vehicle instances that we detected.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in semantic image segmentation have mostly been achieved by training deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the task. We show how to improve semantic segmentation through the use of contextual information. Specifically, we explore â€˜patch-patch' context and â€˜patch-background' context with deep CNNs. For learning the patch-patch context between image regions, we formulate Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) with CNN-based pairwise potential functions to capture semantic correlations between neighboring patches. Efficient piecewise training of the proposed deep structured model is then applied to avoid repeated expensive CRF inference for back propagation. In order to capture the patch-background context, we show that a network design with traditional multi-scale image input and sliding pyramid pooling is effective for improving performance. Our experiment results set new state-of-the-art performance on a number of popular semantic segmentation datasets, including NYUDv2, PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL-Context, and SIFT-flow. Particularly, we achieve an intersection-over-union score of \$77.8\$ on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.},

Further improvements can be made if we filter out cars that are not near known streets or inside car parks.

In our experiments we were able to detect about half of all car parks in two major cities. Our method for car park monitoring allows us to find simple trends in car park usage, as well as changes in car park structure.

In many applications, especially including remote sensing, it is not feasible to fully design and train a new ConvNet, as this usually requires a considerable amount of labeled data and demands high computational costs. Therefore, it is important to understand how to obtain the best profit from existing ConvNets. We perform experiments with six popular ConvNets using three remote sensing datasets. We also compare ConvNets in each strategy with existing descriptors and with state-of-the-art baselines. Results point that fine tuning tends to be the best performing strategy. In fact, using the features from the fine-tuned ConvNet with linear SVM obtains the best results. We also achieved state-of-the-art results for the three datasets used.},

There are five challenges: classification, detection, segmentation, action classification, and person layout. In this paper we provide a review of the challenge from 2008\textendash{}2012. The paper is intended for two audiences: algorithm designers, researchers who want to see what the state of the art is, as measured by performance on the VOC datasets, along with the limitations and weak points of the current generation of algorithms; and, challenge designers, who want to see what we as organisers have learnt from the process and our recommendations for the organisation of future challenges. To analyse the performance of submitted algorithms on the VOC datasets we introduce a number of novel evaluation methods: a bootstrapping method for determining whether differences in the performance of two algorithms are significant or not; a normalised average precision so that performance can be compared across classes with different proportions of positive instances; a clustering method for visualising the performance across multiple algorithms so that the hard and easy images can be identified; and the use of a joint classifier over the submitted algorithms in order to measure their complementarity and combined performance. We also analyse the community's progress through time using the methods of Hoiem et al. (Proceedings of European Conference on Computer Vision, 2012) to identify the types of occurring errors. We conclude the paper with an appraisal of the aspects of the challenge that worked well, and those that could be improved in future challenges.},

In this paper, we present Multi-task Network Cascades for instance-aware semantic segmentation. Our model consists of three networks, respectively differentiating instances, estimating masks, and categorizing objects. These networks form a cascaded structure, and are designed to share their convolutional features. We develop an algorithm for the nontrivial end-to-end training of this causal, cascaded structure. Our solution is a clean, single-step training framework and can be generalized to cascades that have more stages. We demonstrate state-of-the-art instance-aware semantic segmentation accuracy on PASCAL VOC. Meanwhile, our method takes only 360ms testing an image using VGG-16, which is two orders of magnitude faster than previous systems for this challenging problem. As a by product, our method also achieves compelling object detection results which surpass the competitive Fast/Faster R-CNN systems. The method described in this paper is the foundation of our submissions to the MS COCO 2015 segmentation competition, where we won the 1st place.},

Semantic segmentation is a fundamental remote sensing task, and most state-of-the-art methods rely on DCNNs as their workhorse. A major reason for their success is that deep networks learn to accumulate contextual information over very large windows (receptive fields). However, this success comes at a cost, since the associated loss of effecive spatial resolution washes out high-frequency details and leads to blurry object boundaries. Here, we propose to counter this effect by combining semantic segmentation with semantically informed edge detection, thus making class-boundaries explicit in the model, First, we construct a comparatively simple, memory-efficient model by adding boundary detection to the Segnet encoder-decoder architecture. Second, we also include boundary detection in FCN-type models and set up a high-end classifier ensemble. We show that boundary detection significantly improves semantic segmentation with CNNs. Our high-end ensemble achieves $>$ 90\% overall accuracy on the ISPRS Vaihingen benchmark.},

  abstract = {Learning powerful feature representations is of great importance in order to improve the accuracy of high-resolution remote sensing imagery (HRRSI) scene classification. Generally, traditional methods mainly focus on low-level features. Though these feature representations can achieve satisfactory performance to some extent, the performance improvement is small. More importantly, these low-level feature representations are hand-crafted features, and it is difficult to design such a holistic feature representation. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNN) has achieved remarkable performance on several natural benchmarks. In this paper, we investigate the extraction of the deep feature representations based on the pre-trained CNN architectures for scene classification tasks. More specially, we first evaluate the pre-trained CNN architectures on a public scene dataset and then fine-tune the CNN that performs best on the dataset using the target HRRSI dataset to learn dataset-specific features. Extensive experiments on two publicly available scene datasets indicate that the deep feature representations can achieve state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract = {The trend towards higher resolution remote sensing imagery facilitates a transition from land-use classification to object-level scene understanding. Rather than relying purely on spectral content, appearance-based image features come into play. In this work, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are applied to semantic labelling of high-resolution remote sensing data. Recent advances in fully convolutional networks (FCNs) are adapted to overhead data and shown to be as effective as in other domains. A full-resolution labelling is inferred using a deep FCN with no downsampling, obviating the need for deconvolution or interpolation. To make better use of image features, a pre-trained CNN is fine-tuned on remote sensing data in a hybrid network context, resulting in superior results compared to a network trained from scratch. The proposed approach is applied to the problem of labelling high-resolution aerial imagery, where fine boundary detail is important. The dense labelling yields state-of-the-art accuracy for the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam benchmark data sets.},

  title = {Optimal {{Transport}} for {{Domain Adaptation}}},
  abstract = {Domain adaptation is one of the most chal- lenging tasks of modern data analytics. If the adapta- tion is done correctly, models built on a specific data representation become more robust when confronted to data depicting the same classes, but described by another observation system. Among the many strategies proposed, finding domain-invariant representations has shown excel- lent properties, in particular since it allows to train a unique classifier effective in all domains. In this paper, we propose a regularized unsupervised optimal transportation model to perform the alignment of the representations in the source and target domains. We learn a transportation plan matching both PDFs, which constrains labeled samples of the same class in the source domain to remain close during transport. This way, we exploit at the same time the labeled samples in the source and the distributions observed in both domains. Experiments on toy and challenging real visual adaptation examples show the interest of the method, that consistently outperforms state of the art approaches. In addition, numerical experiments show that our approach leads to better performances on domain invariant deep learning features and can be easily adapted to the semi- supervised case where few labeled samples are available in the target domain.},

Recently encoder-decoder type fully convolutional CNN architectures have achieved a great success in the field of semantic segmentation. Motivated by this observation we propose an encoder-decoder type network, where the encoder part is composed of two branches of networks that simultaneously extract features from RGB and depth images and fuse depth features into the RGB feature maps as the network goes deeper. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed fusion-based architecture achieves competitive results with the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging SUN RGB-D benchmark obtaining 76.27\% global accuracy, 48.30\% average class accuracy and 37.29\% average intersection-over-union score.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8\texttimes{} deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset.

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation.

We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet [20], the VGG net [31], and GoogLeNet [32]) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning [3] to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20\% relative improvement to 62.2\% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes less than one fifth of a second for a typical image.},

  abstract = {We present a novel and practical deep fully convolutional neural network architecture for semantic pixel-wise segmentation termed SegNet. This core trainable segmentation engine consists of an encoder network, a corresponding decoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The architecture of the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13 convolutional layers in the VGG16 network [1]. The role of the decoder network is to map the low resolution encoder feature maps to full input resolution feature maps for pixel-wise classification. The novelty of SegNet lies is in the manner in which the decoder upsamples its lower resolution input feature map(s). Specifically, the decoder uses pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of the corresponding encoder to perform non-linear upsampling. This eliminates the need for learning to upsample. The upsampled maps are sparse and are then convolved with trainable filters to produce dense feature maps. We compare our proposed architecture with the widely adopted FCN [2] and also with the well known DeepLab-LargeFOV [3], DeconvNet [4] architectures. This comparison reveals the memory versus accuracy trade-off involved in achieving good segmentation performance. SegNet was primarily motivated by scene understanding applications. Hence, it is designed to be efficient both in terms of memory and computational time during inference. It is also significantly smaller in the number of trainable parameters than other competing architectures and can be trained end-to-end using stochastic gradient descent. We also performed a controlled benchmark of SegNet and other architectures on both road scenes and SUN RGB-D indoor scene segmentation tasks. These quantitative assessments show that SegNet provides good performance with competitive inference time and most efficient inference memory-wise as compared to other architectures. We also provide a Caffe implementation of SegNet and a web demo at http://mi.eng.cam.a- .uk/projects/segnet/.},

While rather than using the networks as a blackbox feature extractor, we customize the training strategy by partitioning contour (positive) data into subclasses and fitting each subclass by different model parameters. A new loss function, named positive-sharing loss, in which each subclass shares the loss for the whole positive class, is proposed to learn the parameters. Compared to the sofmax loss function, the proposed one, introduces an extra regularizer to emphasizes the losses for the positive and negative classes, which facilitates to explore more discriminative features.

Recent approaches have attempted to harness the capabilities of deep learning techniques for image recognition to tackle pixel-level labelling tasks. One central issue in this methodology is the limited capacity of deep learning techniques to delineate visual objects. To solve this problem, we introduce a new form of convolutional neural network that combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)-based probabilistic graphical modelling. To this end, we formulate Conditional Random Fields with Gaussian pairwise potentials and mean-field approximate inference as Recurrent Neural Networks. This network, called CRF-RNN, is then plugged in as a part of a CNN to obtain a deep network that has desirable properties of both CNNs and CRFs. Importantly, our system fully integrates CRF modelling with CNNs, making it possible to train the whole deep network end-to-end with the usual back-propagation algorithm, avoiding offline post-processing methods for object delineation. We apply the proposed method to the problem of semantic image segmentation, obtaining top results on the challenging Pascal VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark.},

With 21 participating algorithms and a data repository consisting of 13 data sets from various microscopy modalities, the challenge displays today's state-of-the-art methodology in the field. We analyzed the challenge results using performance measures for segmentation and tracking that rank all participating methods. We also analyzed the performance of all of the algorithms in terms of biological measures and practical usability. Although some methods scored high in all technical aspects, none obtained fully correct solutions. We found that methods that either take prior information into account using learning strategies or analyze cells in a global spatiotemporal video context performed better than other methods under the segmentation and tracking scenarios included in the challenge.},

These applications share the need for accurate detection of relevant vehicles, e.g. in aerial imagery. Recently, the application of deep learning based detection frameworks like Faster R-CNN clearly outperformed conventional detection methods for vehicle detection in aerial images. In this paper, we propose a detection framework that fuses Faster R-CNN and semantic labeling to integrate contextual information. We achieve an improved detection performance by decreasing the number of false positive detections while the number of candidate regions to classify is reduced. To demonstrate the generalization of our approach, we evaluate our detection framework for various ground sampling distances on a publicly available dataset.},

In the literature it is common to use a single image and split it into training and test sets to train a classifier and assess its performance, respectively. However, this does not prove the generalization capabilities to other inputs. In this paper, we propose an aerial image labeling dataset that covers a wide range of urban settlement appearances, from different geographic locations. Moreover, the cities included in the test set are different from those of the training set. We also experiment with convolutional neural networks on our dataset.},

In this paper, we introduce an RGB-D benchmark suite for the goal of advancing the state-of-the-arts in all major scene understanding tasks. Our dataset is captured by four different sensors and contains 10,335 RGB-D images, at a similar scale as PASCAL VOC. The whole dataset is densely annotated and includes 146,617 2D polygons and 64,595 3D bounding boxes with accurate object orientations, as well as a 3D room layout and scene category for each image. This dataset enables us to train data-hungry algorithms for scene-understanding tasks, evaluate them using meaningful 3D metrics, avoid overfitting to a small testing set, and study cross-sensor bias.},

  volume = {1704},
  abstract = {Variational Level Set (LS) has been a widely used method in medical 
segmentation. However, it is limited when dealing with multi-instance
objects in the real world. In addition, its segmentation results are
quite sensitive to initial settings and highly depend on the number of
iterations. To address these issues and boost the classic variational LS
methods to a new level of the learnable deep learning approaches, we
propose a novel definition of contour evolution named Recurrent Level
Set (RLS)\vphantom\{\} to employ Gated Recurrent Unit under the energy minimization
of a variational LS functional. The curve deformation process in RLS is
formed as a hidden state evolution procedure and updated by minimizing
an energy functional composed of fitting forces and contour length. By
sharing the convolutional features in a fully end-to-end trainable
framework, we extend RLS to Contextual RLS (CRLS) to address semantic
segmentation in the wild. The experimental results have shown that our
proposed RLS improves both computational time and segmentation accuracy
against the classic variations LS-based method, whereas the fully
end-to-end system CRLS achieves competitive performance compared to the
state-of-the-art semantic segmentation approaches.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

  abstract = {Object segmentation requires both object-level information and low-level pixel data. This presents a challenge for feedforward networks: lower layers in convolutional nets capture rich spatial information, while upper layers encode object-level knowledge but are invariant to factors such as pose and appearance. In this work we propose to augment feedforward nets for object segmentation with a novel top-down refinement approach. The resulting bottom-up/top-down architecture is capable of efficiently generating high-fidelity object masks. Similarly to skip connections, our approach leverages features at all layers of the net. Unlike skip connections, our approach does not attempt to output independent predictions at each layer. Instead, we first output a coarse `mask encoding' in a feedforward pass, then refine this mask encoding in a top-down pass utilizing features at successively lower layers. The approach is simple, fast, and effective. Building on the recent DeepMask network for generating object proposals, we show accuracy improvements of 10\textendash{}20\% in average recall for various setups. Additionally, by optimizing the overall network architecture, our approach, which we call SharpMask, is 50 \% faster than the original DeepMask network (under .8 s per image).},

  abstract = {The increased availability of high resolution satellite imagery allows to sense very detailed structures on the surface of our planet. Access to such information opens up new directions in the analysis of remote sensing imagery. However, at the same time this raises a set of new challenges for existing pixel-based prediction methods, such as semantic segmentation approaches. While deep neural networks have achieved significant advances in the semantic segmentation of high resolution images in the past, most of the existing approaches tend to produce predictions with poor boundaries. In this paper, we address the problem of preserving semantic segmentation boundaries in high resolution satellite imagery by introducing a new cascaded multi-task loss. We evaluate our approach on Inria Aerial Image Labeling Dataset which contains large-scale and high resolution images. Our results show that we are able to outperform state-of-the-art methods by 8.3$\backslash$\% without any additional post-processing step.},

  abstract = {Establishing up-to-date large scale building maps is essential to understand urban dynamics, such as estimating population, urban planning and many other applications. Although many computer vision tasks has been successfully carried out with deep convolutional neural networks, there is a growing need to understand their large scale impact on building mapping with remote sensing imagery. Taking advantage of the scalability of CNNs and using only few areas with the abundance of building footprints, for the first time we conduct a comparative analysis of four state-of-the-art CNNs for extracting building footprints across the entire continental United States. The four CNN architectures namely: branch-out CNN, fully convolutional neural network (FCN), conditional random field as recurrent neural network (CRFasRNN), and SegNet, support semantic pixel-wise labeling and focus on capturing textural information at multi-scale. We use 1-meter resolution aerial images from National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) as the test-bed, and compare the extraction results across the four methods. In addition, we propose to combine signed-distance labels with SegNet, the preferred CNN architecture identified by our extensive evaluations, to advance building extraction results to instance level. We further demonstrate the usefulness of fusing additional near IR information into the building extraction framework. Large scale experimental evaluations are conducted and reported using metrics that include: precision, recall rate, intersection over union, and the number of buildings extracted. With the improved CNN model and no requirement of further post-processing, we have generated building maps for the United States. The quality of extracted buildings and processing time demonstrated the proposed CNN-based framework fits the need of building extraction at scale.},

Secondly, image segmentation and edge detection algorithms were performed to separate vehicles from the background in the road region. Then, a fuzzy logic classifier was constructed to classify the extracted object regions into the vehicle and the non-vehicle regions by using the feature information of image objects. Finally, based on the calculated average length and width of vehicles, we classified vehicles into three categories, that is, small, medium and big. And the counts of the three vehicle classes were derived. The automatic counts match manual counts very well.},

  abstract = {Detecting vehicles in aerial imagery plays an important role in a wide range of applications. The current vehicle detection methods are mostly based on sliding-window search and handcrafted or shallow-learning-based features, having limited description capability and heavy computational costs. Recently, due to the powerful feature representations, region convolutional neural networks (CNN) based detection methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in computer vision, especially Faster R-CNN. However, directly using it for vehicle detection in aerial images has many limitations: (1) region proposal network (RPN) in Faster R-CNN has poor performance for accurately locating small-sized vehicles, due to the relatively coarse feature maps; and (2) the classifier after RPN cannot distinguish vehicles and complex backgrounds well. In this study, an improved detection method based on Faster R-CNN is proposed in order to accomplish the two challenges mentioned above. Firstly, to improve the recall, we employ a hyper region proposal network (HRPN) to extract vehicle-like targets with a combination of hierarchical feature maps. Then, we replace the classifier after RPN by a cascade of boosted classifiers to verify the candidate regions, aiming at reducing false detection by negative example mining. We evaluate our method on the Munich vehicle dataset and the collected vehicle dataset, with improvements in accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods.},

In recent years, several deep learning based frameworks have been proposed for object detection. However, these detectors were developed for datasets that considerably differ from aerial images. In this paper, we systematically investigate the potential of Fast R-CNN and Faster R-CNN for aerial images, which achieve top performing results on common detection benchmark datasets. Therefore, the applicability of 8 state-of-the-art object proposals methods used to generate a set of candidate regions and of both detectors is examined. Relevant adaptations of the object proposals methods are provided. To overcome shortcomings of the original approach in case of handling small instances, we further propose our own network that clearly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for vehicle detection in aerial images. All experiments are performed on two publicly available datasets to account for differing characteristics such as ground sampling distance, number of objects per image and varying backgrounds.},

Advances like SPPnet [1] and Fast R-CNN [2] have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network(RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features-using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model [3], our detection system has a frame rate of 5 fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image.

  abstract = {Detection of small objects in large swaths of imagery is one of the primary problems in satellite imagery analytics. While object detection in ground-based imagery has benefited from research into new deep learning approaches, transitioning such technology to overhead imagery is nontrivial. Among the challenges is the sheer number of pixels and geographic extent per image: a single DigitalGlobe satellite image encompasses $>$64 km2 and over 250 million pixels. Another challenge is that objects of interest are minuscule (often only \textasciitilde{}10 pixels in extent), which complicates traditional computer vision techniques. To address these issues, we propose a pipeline (You Only Look Twice, or YOLT) that evaluates satellite images of arbitrary size at a rate of $>$0.5 km2/s. The proposed approach can rapidly detect objects of vastly different scales with relatively little training data over multiple sensors. We evaluate large test images at native resolution, and yield scores of F1 $>$ 0.8 for vehicle localization. We further explore resolution and object size requirements by systematically testing the pipeline at decreasing resolution, and conclude that objects only \textasciitilde{}5 pixels in size can still be localized with high confidence.

Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is less likely to predict false positives on background.

  abstract = {The automatic creation of 3D models of urban spaces has be- come a very active field of research. This has been inspired by recent applications in the location-awareness on the Inter- net, as demonstrated in maps.live.com and similar websites. The level of automation in creating 3D city models has in- creased considerably, and has benefited from an increase in the redundancy of the source imagery, namely digital aerial photography. In this paper we argue that the next big step forward is to replace photographic texture by an interpreta- tion of what the texture describes, and to achieve this fully automatically. One calls the result "semantic knowledge". For example we want to know that a certain part of the im- age is a car, a person, a building, a tree, a shrub, a window, a door, instead of just a collection of 3D points or triangles with a superimposed photographic texture. We investigate object recognition methods to make this next big step. We demonstrate an early result of using the on-line variant of a Boosting algorithm to indeed detect cars in aerial digital imagery to a satisfactory and useful level of completeness. And we show that we can use this semantic knowledge to produce improved orthophotos. We expect that also the 3D models will be improved by the knowledge of cars.},

Under the framework of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this paper proposes a novel end-to-end network for semantic labeling. Specifically, our network not only improves the labeling accuracy of complex manmade objects by aggregating multiple context semantics with a cascaded architecture, but also refines fine-structured objects by utilizing the low-level detail in shallow layers of CNNs with a hierarchical pyramid structure. Throughout the network, a dedicated residual correction scheme is employed to amend the latent fitting residual. As a result of these specific components, the whole model works in a global-to-local and coarse-to-fine manner. Experimental results show that our network outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the large-scale ISPRS Vaihingen 2D Semantic Labeling Challenge dataset.},

  doi = {10.1109/ICIP.2017.8297076},
  abstract = {This paper addresses the question of the detection of small targets (vehicles) in ortho-images. This question differs from the general task of detecting objects in images by several aspects. First, the vehicles to be detected are small, typically smaller than 20\texttimes{}20 pixels. Second, due to the multifarious-ness of the landscapes of the earth, several pixel structures similar to that of a vehicle might emerge (roof tops, shadow patterns, rocks, buildings), whereas within the vehicle class the inter-class variability is limited as they all look alike from afar. Finally, the imbalance between the vehicles and the rest of the picture is enormous in most cases. Specifically, this paper is focused on the detection tasks introduced by the VEDAI dataset [1]. This work supports an extensive study of the problems one might face when applying deep neural networks with low resolution and scarce data and proposes some solutions. One of the contributions of this paper is a network severely outperforming the state-of-the-art while being much simpler to implement and a lot faster than competitive approaches. We also list the limitations of this approach and provide several new ideas to further improve our results.},

  shorttitle = {Large-Scale Semantic Classification},
  abstract = {Over the recent years, there has been an increasing interest in large-scale classification of remote sensing images. In this context, the Inria Aerial Image Labeling Benchmark has been released online in December 2016. In this paper, we discuss the outcomes of the first year of the benchmark contest, which consisted in dense labeling of aerial images into building / not building classes, covering areas of five cities not present in the training set. We present four methods with the highest numerical accuracies, all four being convolutional neural network approaches. It is remarkable that three of these methods use the U-net architecture, which has thus proven to become a new standard in image dense labeling.},
