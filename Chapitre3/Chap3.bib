  abstract = {Empirical studies report several plausible correlations between transforms of spectral reflectance, called vegetation indexes, and parameters descriptive of vegetation leaf area, biomass and physiological functioning. However, most indexes can be generalized to show a derivative of surface reflectance with respect to wavelength. This derivative is a function of the optical properties of leaves and soil particles. In the case of optically dense vegetation, the spectral derivative, and thus the indexes, can be rigorously shown to be indicative of the abundance and activity of the absorbers in the leaves. Therefore, the widely used broad-band red/near-infrared vegetation indexes are a measure of chlorophyll abundance and energy absorption},

  abstract = {The huge earthquake of magnitude 6.3 had occurred at Bam city of southeastern Iran on December 26, 2003. The author applied nonlinear mapping method for detection of collapsed building area due to Iran earthquake with high-resolution QuickBird satellite images. As a result, ROC evaluation based on the result of photo interpretation by operator showed that the detection ratio of the proposed method is 75-90\% of changed area with 20\% of false alarm.},
