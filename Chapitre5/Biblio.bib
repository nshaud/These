  abstract = {Spectral observations along the spectrum in many narrow spectral bands through hyperspectral imaging provides valuable information towards material and object recognition, which can be consider as a classification task. Most of the existing studies and research efforts are following the conventional pattern recognition paradigm, which is based on the construction of complex handcrafted features. However, it is rarely known which features are important for the problem at hand. In contrast to these approaches, we propose a deep learning based classification method that hierarchically constructs high-level features in an automated way. Our method exploits a Convolutional Neural Network to encode pixels' spectral and spatial information and a Multi-Layer Perceptron to conduct the classification task. Experimental results and quantitative validation on widely used datasets showcasing the potential of the developed approach for accurate hyperspectral data classification.},

  abstract = {Due to the advantages of deep learning, in this paper, a regularized deep feature extraction (FE) method is presented for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed approach employs several convolutional and pooling layers to extract deep features from HSIs, which are nonlinear, discriminant, and invariant. These features are useful for image classification and target detection. Furthermore, in order to address the common issue of imbalance between high dimensionality and limited availability of training samples for the classification of HSI, a few strategies such as L2 regularization and dropout are investigated to avoid overfitting in class data modeling. More importantly, we propose a 3-D CNN-based FE model with combined regularization to extract effective spectral-spatial features of hyperspectral imagery. Finally, in order to further improve the performance, a virtual sample enhanced method is proposed. The proposed approaches are carried out on three widely used hyperspectral data sets: Indian Pines, University of Pavia, and Kennedy Space Center. The obtained results reveal that the proposed models with sparse constraints provide competitive results to state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the proposed deep FE opens a new window for further research.},

  abstract = {Hyperspectral imaging sensors are becoming increasingly popular in robotics applications such as agriculture and mining, and allow per-pixel thematic classification of materials in a scene based on their unique spectral signatures. Recently, convolutional neural networks have shown remarkable performance for classification tasks, but require substantial amounts of labelled training data. This data must sufficiently cover the variability expected to be encountered in the environment. For hyperspectral data, one of the main variations encountered outdoors is due to incident illumination, which can change in spectral shape and intensity depending on the scene geometry. For example, regions occluded from the sun have a lower intensity and their incident irradiance skewed towards shorter wavelengths. In this work, a data augmentation strategy based on relighting is used during training of a hyperspectral convolutional neural network. It allows training to occur in the outdoor environment given only a small labelled region, which does not need to sufficiently represent the geometric variability of the entire scene. This is important for applications where obtaining large amounts of training data is labourious, hazardous or difficult, such as labelling pixels within shadows. Radiometric normalisation approaches for pre-processing the hyperspectral data are analysed and it is shown that methods based on the raw pixel data are sufficient to be used as input for the classifier. This removes the need for external hardware such as calibration boards, which can restrict the application of hyperspectral sensors in robotics applications. Experiments to evaluate the classification system are carried out on two datasets captured from a field-based platform.},

  abstract = {Spectral-spatial classification of remotely sensed hyperspectral images has been the subject of many studies in recent years. Current methods achieve excellent performance on benchmark hyperspectral image labeling tasks when a sufficient number of labeled pixels is available. However, in the presence of only very few labeled pixels, such classification becomes a challenging problem. In this paper we propose to tackle this problem using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and data augmentation. Our newly developed method relies on the assumption of spectral-spatial locality: nearby pixels in a hyperspectral image are related, in the sense that their spectra and their labels are likely to be similar. We exploit this assumption to develop 1) a new data augmentation procedure which adds new samples to the train set and 2) a tailored loss function which penalize differences among weights of the network corresponding to nearby wavelengths of the spectra. We train a simple single layer convolutional neural network with this loss function and augmented train set and use it to classify all unlabeled pixels of the given image. To assess the efficacy of our method, we used five publicly available hyperspectral images: Pavia Center, Pavia University, KSC, Indian Pines and Salina. On these images our method significantly outperforms other baselines. Notably, with just 1\% of labeled pixels per class, on these dataset our method achieves an accuracy of 99.5\%, etc. Furthermore we show that our method improves over other baselines also in a supervised setting, when no overlap between train and test pixels is allowed. Overall our investigation demonstrates that spectral-spatial locality can be easily embedded in a simple convolutional neural network through data augmentation and a tailored loss function.},

In hyperspectral remote sensing (HSRS), feature data can potentially become very high dimensional. However, the amount of training data is oftentimes limited. Thus, one of the core challenges in HSRS is how to perform multiclass classification using only relatively few training data points. In this letter, we address this issue by enriching the feature matrix with synthetically generated sample points. These synthetic data are sampled from a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) fitted to each class of the limited training data. Although the true distribution of features may not be perfectly modeled by the fitted GMM, we demonstrate that a moderate augmentation by these synthetic samples can effectively replace a part of the missing training samples. Doing so, the median gain in classification performance is 5\% on two datasets. This performance gain is stable for variations in the number of added samples, which makes it easy to apply this method to real-world applications.},

  abstract = {A weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) method aims to learn a segmentation model from weak (image-level) as opposed to strong (pixel-level) labels. By avoiding the tedious pixel-level annotation process, it can exploit the unlimited supply of user-tagged images from media-sharing sites such as Flickr for large scale applications. However, these ‘free' tags/labels are often noisy and few existing works address the problem of learning with both weak and noisy labels. In this work, we cast the WSSS problem into a label noise reduction problem. Specifically, after segmenting each image into a set of superpixels, the weak and potentially noisy image-level labels are propagated to the superpixel level resulting in highly noisy labels; the key to semantic segmentation is thus to identify and correct the superpixel noisy labels. To this end, a novel L\textsubscript{1}-optimisation based sparse learning model is formulated to directly and explicitly detect noisy labels. To solve the L\textsubscript{1}-optimisation problem, we further develop an efficient learning algorithm by introducing an intermediate labelling variable. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our method yields state-of-the-art results given noise-free labels, whilst significantly outperforming the existing methods when the weak labels are also noisy.},
